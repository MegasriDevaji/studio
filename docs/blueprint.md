## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: True dark (#0B0F14) to provide a modern and sleek aesthetic. This background enhances the visibility of other UI elements while reducing eye strain in low-light environments.
- Primary accent color: Electric teal (#00E5A8). This vivid color will be used for primary interactive elements such as the Quick Add button and key action indicators. The choice of teal evokes a sense of digital sophistication.
- Secondary accent color: Violet (#8A5CFF). It serves as a highlight for less frequent actions and visual accents throughout the app, providing a playful contrast to the teal. This hue promotes creativity.
- Headings font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) SemiBold for titles and headings, providing a crisp, modern, and readable appearance.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) Regular for body text and labels, ensuring clarity and legibility.
- Use rounded line icons with filled micro-accents (Material Design or custom) to maintain a consistent and user-friendly interface. Icons must match accent colors.
- Implement smooth, subtle animations (120-200ms easing) for UI interactions such as taps, list insertions/removals, and chart animations, enhancing the user experience.
